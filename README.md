# Programming-for-Data-Analytics-Project

Project assignment to investigate data related data  to a phenomenon, model and synthesise such data using Python and demonstrate its creation in python while discussing background.

Contents of the repository -
This repository contains a notebook used to outline the background information about the phenomenon, the variables in question, the shape the variables would take and how they would be generated using numpy.

The four main objectives of this analysis were to complete the following -

Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.

• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – thedata set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

To meet the above objectives the notebook contains information on the original data set, the relationships between the variables selected and how they were modelled to create the random data set.

How to run the notebook -
To run, edit and view this notebook (Simulation of Data Set) the download option can be used on the dashboard view for this repository. This will download a zip file containing the notebook and files related to this assignment.

In order to use this notebook it is required to have the correct packages installed which allow jupyter notebook to be utilised on the machine being used to view this file. The most popular way to install this, and multiple other useful packages, is through the use of Anaconda. [1]

Once the relevant file has been downloaded locally to your machine, and you have installed the packages required to utilise jupyter notebooks, the command jupyter notebook can be ran through any command line interface which you may have installed. This can be ran from your home folder or by using the "cd" command to the folder in which you have downloaded the notebooks files. This will lead to a pop up window of Jupyter notebook to be opened and a list of files in the folder you have ran this command from should appear. Following this you will need to locate the notebook file on your machine using the file structure in Jupyter notebook.

Once the file has been opened the Cell, run all, commands can be used to re-run any code cells to view the results etc. The various functions which can be used in the jupyter notebooks to view, edit and run the cells, text or code, can be found on their website here or through the various cheat sheets available online.
