    "\n",
    "Whether height as a premier league striker has an impact on the number of headers/goals scored in a season. In order to obtain correct data which this random data set will be modelled from the statistics were averaged and calculated from the 14/15 to 17/18 seasons in the English Premier League.\n",
    "\n",
    "*__Types of variables involved -__*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) *__Height of the player__*\n",
    "\n",
    "Average height of the strikers whom scored goals over the time frame in question is 181.5 cm. The minimum and maximum heights noted are - 169 and 201 cm respectively. With a standard deviation of 6.8 cm.\n",
    "The height of the individual player will be a non-negative real number with one decimal place.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) *__The minute played__*\n",
    "\n",
    "Average minutes played of the strikers listed over the years in question is 3674. The minimum and maximum minutes noted are - 1 and 12185 mins respectively.\n",
    "The minutes played for each of the players in the simulated dataset will be a non-negative real number with no decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) *__Total goals scored__*\n",
    "\n",
    "Average total goals scored of the strikers listed over the years in question is 15.5. The minimum and maximum total goals scored noted are - 0 and 105 mins respectively.\n",
    "For such statistics in sport the values are generally rounded to one decimal place, therefore, in the case of this study the value of the total goals scored being simulated will be a non-negative real number with one decimal place.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) *__Total headed goals scored__*\n",
    "\n",
    "Average total headed goals scored of the strikers listed over the years in question is 2.7. The minimum and maximum total goals scored noted are - 0 and 21 mins respectively.\n",
    "Similar to the previous statement, such statistics in sport the values are generally rounded to one decimal place, therefore, in the case of this study the value of the total headed goals scored being simulated will be a non-negative real number with one decimal place.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A) For strikers in the original data set between 201 and 185 cm, the average proportion of headed goals scored was 21%.\n",
    "    B) For strikers in the original data set between 184 and 178 cm the average proportion of headed goals scored was 15%.\n",
    "    C) For strikers in the original data set between 177 and 169 cm the average proportion of headed goals scored was 9%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Likely distributions -\n",
    "\n",
    "1) *__Height of the player__*\n",
    "\n",
    "As per research human heights generally follow a uniform distribution *[2]*. Therefore a normal distribution can be applied when generating the heights in the case of this simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) *__The minute played__*\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard number of minutes which can be played in the premier league matches in a season is 3420.\n",
    "The number of minutes played by a player follows a normal distribution as some players can play no minutes over the season due injuries etc..\n",
    "This variable would not be as closely related to height as it would to the goals scored or per-centage of headed goals scored. The more minutes played would impact on the total goals scored as it is typically expected that a player has a higher probability of scoring more goals if they play more minutes over the course of a season.\n",
    "(Total number of matches) 38 x 90 (Length of a standard match) = 3420 possible minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "3) *__Total goals scored__*\n",
    "\n",
    "4) *__Percentage of headed goals scored out of total goals scored__*\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be generally assumed that a player's height should mean that they would score more headed goals than smaller opponent strikers. I believe that minutes played would also have an impact on this as if a striker plays less minutes over a season or more they should score more goals than someone who plays a lot less minutes whether it be headed goals or in any other fashion.\n",

    "\n",
    "As I am a big sports fan I decide to choose the real-world phenomenon of the difference in headed goals scored depending on the height of a striker. I have researched the background and determined that in order to examine this phenomenon the following variables would be analysed for the purpose of simulating this dataset –\n",
    "\n",
    "1)\tHeight of the striker\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tMinutes played in a season\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tTotal goals scored\n",
    "\n",
    "4)\tHeaded goals scored\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that the players height does have an impact on the number of headed goals scored per centage they would score over a smaller player. While the total number of goals gives an idea on how prolific the striker is aside from height, therefore indicating the impact their height has on the number of headed goals scored. The minutes played in a season would also need to be measured in order to give an idea of the impact the striker has, as less minutes played means that they have less of a chance of scoring a high number of total goals as well as headed goals.\n",
    "Following research of the topic, I have founded that the following listed variables are the average values for each of the 4 variables mentioned previously over the last 4 premier league seasons – \n",
    "A) Average height of the strikers over this time was 181.5 cm, with a standard deviation of 6.8 cm.\n",
    "B) Average number of headed goals scored by the strikers present in the league over this time was 3, with a standard deviation of 4 when both values are rounded.\n",
    "C) Average total goals scored by the strikers present in the league over this time was 15, with a standard deviation of 18 when both values are rounded.\n",
    "D) Average minutes played by the strikers present in the league over this time was 3665 with a standard deviation of 3309 when both values are rounded. While it should be noted that over a course of a season of 38 games of 90 minutes it is possible for players to play 3420 minutes, over 4 seasons this total would be 13680 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*__Height__*\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*__Goals Scored__*\n",
    "\n",
    "Would be a non-negative, but possibly zero, random integer which would be based on the minutes played by the player. This would be due to the fact that the less minutes a player has played it would be expected for them to score less goals in total than a striker who plays every minute of the season in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "*__Per-centage Headed Goals Scored__*\n",
    "\n",
    "Would be a non-negative, but possibly zero, random integer that represents the likely per-centage of the total goals which were headed goals for each player. This would be based upon both the total goals scored and therefore also minutes played. It would also be based upon height as this data set will assume that taller players would have a higher headed goals per centage of their total than smaller players would have.\n",
    "\n",
    "*__Minutes Played__*\n",
    "\n",
    "Would be a non-negative, but possibly zero, random integer based around the mean minutes played in the real data set along with the std. deviation.\n",
    "Minutes played in each match are independent of the next match. Set number of trials = 38 matches. Each minute the player either plays (0) or doesn’t play (1)\n",
