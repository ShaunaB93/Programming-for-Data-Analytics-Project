    "# Project Statement - \n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could\n",
    "collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their\n",
    "relationships with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some\n",
    "students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to\n",
    "base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),\n",
    "but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. The next section\n",
    "gives an example project idea."
